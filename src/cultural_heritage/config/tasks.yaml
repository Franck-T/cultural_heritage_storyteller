#steps on how to get an video sources :
#    -Here is a sample python script on how to request the image located at: {path_req_img}
#    -Here is a sample of the response once you have executed the request and got the response; located at: {path_res_img}
#    -By using the sample of the response, you have to extract from the 3rd result the "imageUrl" key to

heritage_research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct comprehensive, multidisciplinary research focused on Afro-Canadian cultural heritage in New Brunswick.
    The agent must gather detailed biographical data, cultural context, and relevant multimedia references (images, audio, video)
    for potential cultural heritage candidates. Research must be verified against authoritative sources such as official government
    websites and cultural heritage databases.

    steps on how to get an image with the tool at your disposal:
    -Here is a sample python script on how to request the image located at: {path_req_img}
     use that to construct the request parameters.
    -Here is a sample of the response once you have executed the request and got the response; located at: {path_res_img}
    -By using the sample of the response, you have to extract from the 1st and 2nd results the value of the  "imageUrl" key inside the array of image with the key "images" to 
    get the url of the image and insert it in your final report. 
    
    The output must be a list of 10 persons structured json document that includes:

heritage_writing_task:
  description: >
    Based on the report produced by the cultural_heritage_researcher Agent, craft a compelling, immersive narrative that tells
    the story of each of the selected Afro-Canadian cultural heritage candidate. The narrative must be divided into structured sections
    (Introduction, Background, Achievements, Legacy) and incorporate multimedia elements.
    research the format of the storytelling to be used and generate a storytelling structure.
    Use the structure to craft a beyond level expert level storytelling content by using the information of the previous agent.
    Also include multimedia contains if any and all the sources of all research sources used 
    
    also research already written sources to better understand how to come out with a beyond level expert, value driven and informative report     that will bring a clear information to the user
    such that he can say: oooh I did not know these things about the person or that they were even
    existing.
    Here is the date of today:{date}, use it in your generation.
    You are expected to have as output a markdown file containing 10 stories writtent according to what was stated 
    above about the afro candicate provided with the imageUrl  of the candidate  included for eager loading and the sources of findings for each candidate story.
  expected_output: >
    a markdown file  well formatted 10 storytelling   containing a perfect, beyond expert, history level story about the 10 candidates with cultural tones, human tones, emotional tones,
    history and storytelling tones. At most 3000 characters with the imageUrl  of the candidate  included for eager loading and the sources of findings for each candidate story  at the correct place.

#   For a selected cultural heritage candidate (starting with Afro-Canadian stories in New Brunswick and extending to Canada and the USA),
#   the agent must:
#   - Research and extract a comprehensive narrative outlining the candidate's background, achievements, and cultural legacy.
#   - Divide the narrative into clearly defined sections (e.g., Introduction, picture of the person,  Background, Achievements, Legacy).
#   - Integrate multimedia elements:
#     * Format the narrative text for high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis.
#     * Retrieve a relevant image (URL or file path) to visually represent the candidate.
#   Some sources for your research could include: "sources": [

    Now you must not source the same resources used in the report of the first task but 
    look for new sources. Thus you must not source: 
    -government websites 
    - "https://www.newbrunswick.ca"
    -"https://www.afrocanadian.ca", 
    -"https://www.canadaculture.ca"
    -"https://www.nbblackhistorysociety.org"
    but look for other sources that were never sources before so far or that the websites above 
    could have missed and provide them...
